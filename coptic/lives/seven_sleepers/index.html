			<p class="translation">The martyrdom of the seven children in the city of Ephesos, during the time of Emperor Decius, whose names are these: Akhilletes, Diometes, Probatios, Sabbatios, Eugenios, Kyriakos, Stephanos. And they completed their martyrdom on the twenty-fifth of the month of Mesore, in God's peace. Bless us, Amen. ⳾ Now in the first year of Emperor Decius, he came to Ephesos from the city of Khartagenna. And as he reached that place, at that very moment, he entered the temple of the vain gods in order to offer up sacrifice to the demons. And that entire surrounding countryside gathered with him. And the churches of the faithful ones dispersed, and all of the priests and the Christians were very afraid of the tyrant's presence. And at the time Decius entered</p>

			<p class="translation">Ephesos, his heart was arrogant. He began construction of an idolatrous temple in the middle of town. And as he worshipped paganism, he tasked those who were oldest in the city with offering up sacrifice to his gods. And they defiled their bodies with the aroma of the offerings. And the entire crowd gathered into the temple of the idols that was in Ephesos. And the smoke of their offerings, and the stench of their evildoings, covered the city. And it was seeping out of the city, and covering its walls. And when Emperor Decius threw a feast for his vain gods, he ordered that all the crowds gather for his feast. So at that time, the numerous crowds gathered from every place into the temples of the vain idols. And they offered up sacrifice to the vain idols. And the entire city stunk from their offerings. And the Christians were in much grief, humiliated by the idol worshippers. And they fled, hiding,</p>

And the pagans and the Jews had sided with the soldiers, bringing out the Christians, drawing them out of the houses and the caves, prodding them angrily, bringing them directly to the crowds gathered to offer up sacrifice to the emperor's gods. Now some were afraid of the soldiers, and had slipped and fallen through arrogant faith, having served the idols. After these things, the rest of the Christians were in grief because of those who became cowards, having joined them in the offerings to the idols. And those who were found steadfast in the faith were relying on faith, their hearts unmoving, and they didn't expect the wrath of the tyrant, receiving</p>

And they were thrown to the ground like shit. And their blood and their limbs poured out over the ground. And the bodies of the holy ones were sacrificed on the towers and the walls of the city, being suspended by wood, and the crows and the birds were consuming their flesh, and were circling the walls of the city, consuming the bodies of the holy ones. And fear and trembling was among the Christians. And that generation was distressed, and strife filled those who saw it with fear. This is that miraculous struggle. Those of heaven and those of earth rejoiced over it. The stones of the walls were in grief over the crisis present in the city, and the covered parts</p>

Those who are very far from you, you ask them to make an offering to the gods. Behold, now, those who have drawn near to you. They do not care about the well-being of the empire, or your orders. They do not obey them, or perform them. And they reject them, and they dismiss your rules, serving the faith of the Christians under your empire in secret.

So approach now, and offer up sacrifice to my gods, like your friends did.” Akhillites then replied, and said to the emperor, “We have our god in the hidden, from whose glory heaven and earth are filled, and it is he to whom we will offer up hidden sacrifice, through the fulfillment of our hearts and the diligence of our request which is always obvious to him. For we are the smell of the polluted smoke of your sacrifices, and we will not offer it up, and we cannot defile the purity of our souls</p>

And the emperor ordered the straps of the holy children cut. And he said, “You disobeyed the order of my empire, and have not served my gods. Because of this, you too have become foreigners to my empire. And if I find the time, I will try you severely, and question if whatever you say is true to destroy your youth in an instant through tortures, and snuff out your form. For I'll give you time so that you'll wise up about it and return to your life.” The emperor then ordered an iron collar placed</p>

And like this, he returned to Ephesos with arrogance. And while these holy ones found the time, Akhilletes defended himself along with his other friends. So at that time, their righteous deeds were fulfilled through their faith. And they took gold and silver from their belongings, and distributed them to the poor. They then consulted with one another, and said, “Let's spread out a little and go to the cave in the place called Orenokhlon, which is east of the city, and plead quietly to God, with our whole heart, free of any disturbances from the people, until whenever the emperor returns and we're prepared to enter</p>

And after some days, Emperor Decius returned to Ephesos, and immediately ordered the important people of the city to take Akhilletes and his friends with them, and offer up sacrifice to the vain gods.

Still sitting and weeping, they grieved all at once, and slumbered together, and slept. For their eyes were heavy from the despair in their hearts. And God, the generous one who at all hours takes care of the workers of his vineyard, had them die a good and simple death for the miracles which were to come, which he would reveal. And they didn't remember the slumber or their resting, or the exiting of their breath. So like this, they slept on the ground together like with their daily slumbering, and their lives were placed in the hands of the living God, thankful to him through their minds and mouths. And the money they had on them was in their wallets, lying on the ground. And the next morning, the emperor searched for them among the important people of the city and the citizens, and didn't find them.</p>

And the generosity of our power, and it would not remember the evils of those who transgress, and repent, and return to the revered and merciful gods.” And the important people of the city replied, and said to the emperor, “Concerning those children who deserted, may Your Mightiness not …, since they are in their earlier ignorance, and we have likewise heard about the time you've given them in which to repent. They have been sitting, fulfilled in their disobedience. For you have given them the days to notice, and they do not return to the gods. So they took their gold and their silver, and handed it out to the poor of the city. So if it pleases you and Your Mightiness, may their parents be arrested</p>

And when they arrived, they stood before the emperor. And he questioned them, saying, “Where are your children? They have avoided our fearful decree. Thus, I order you put to death for their tyranny.” Their parents replied, and said, “We beg you, Emperor: We do not betray the revered gods of Your Mightiness, so that we won't die on account of those who became deserters, who took our gold and our silver and distributed it to the poor, and are in the cave referred to as Orenokhlon's, and that's somewhere far from the city, living there in great affliction. Whether they are alive or dead, we don't know.” And when he heard these things, he let them go. And the emperor was in great contemplation over those children:</p>

Now, the emperor hadn't done this through his own volition, but rather so that the bodies of the holy martyrs would remain buried there, and their holy remains not be moved whatsoever, since they'd be hidden until the revealing of the Lord's resurrection, so that by the time God visits them they'll have become preachers to unbelievers and those who doubt his resurrection. And the emperor said about them thus: “Those apostates have disobeyed our goodly orders, and showed contempt to the revered gods. They too shall pay the price for their youths, so that they not again live in the presence of the gods. Therefore, let the entrance to that cave be sealed with large stones, so that</p>

Now the eunuchs Theodoros and Varus, and the stewards of the emperor, were Christians, hiding in fear from the persecution. And they consulted with one another, and said, “Let's write a brief blurb about the martyrdom of these holy ones—‘They were holy martyrs, and they died in the name of Christ’—and lay them in a copper casket, and seal them with a seal, and hide them among those stones bordering the cave. For perhaps Christ will visit them before his coming, or the entrance to the cave is opened after some time, and the bodies of those holy ones imprisoned in the cave will be revealed, and their whole accomplishment will be understood through the writings.” And this is how those faithful ones thought, having written about their martyrdom.</p>

			<p class="translation">I will open your tombs, and bring you out of your graves.” And the heretics went astray from the way of life, and the sweetness of the faith was turned, becoming bitter in their souls, and the purity of the heart of the faithful ones was tainted. And Emperor Theodosius was even more upset, and was donning a sackcloth, sitting in ashes in his bedroom. And God is the merciful one who desires to have no one perish in the faith, and desires to give comfort to those who think about mourning the revelation of the eternal resurrection of those who have slept, since he had guarded them up until that time, in order to raise them off the ground, and cast away from them the poison of the grief through the cowardice of the church, and establish its structure out of the strong waves</p>

			<p class="translation">and the evil thoughts of the heretics, who have confused it so that a great light dawns on Emperor Theodosius, and he fulfills the proper faith of his ancestors by the crown of the victor. And in an instant, God gave Anatolios, the lord of that mountain in whose cave the holy martyrs slept, the idea to build a pen for his livestock. And his servants, and others with them, got to work. And others rolled stones away from the entrance to the cave, transferring them to the construction. And on the second day, the entrance to that cave opened. And at that time, through the command of God, our savior, who gives the breath of life to the children who are in their mother's womb, he gave life to these holy ones</p>

			<p class="translation">in the cave. This is his will. And he gave life and comfort to the dry bones on the earth. And his divine voice, which had once summoned Lazarus out of the tomb and granted him life—has now also, through this same command, given the spirit of life to these holy ones. And they got up, and sat down with eager and joyous faces. And they thought about how they were every day, and greeted one another, since there appeared no indication of burial to them. For their clothes fit them well. The way they had fit originally, prior to them sleeping—they still fit them this way as they got up. Their bodies were eager and capable, as if they had slept in the evening and arose in the morning. And the worry and the despair of idol worship was among them,</p>

			<p class="translation">and they thought that Emperor Decius was looking for them. And there was great fear and much contention, for their eyes were heavy. And they were looking at Diometes, their steward. And they asked him what was said about them in the city that night. And Diometes said to them, “I told you already that they looked for you that evening along with the citizens who are important in the city, to have us offer up sacrifice to the idols in the presence of the emperor. And behold, he thinks about us these things. So what will we do? We don't know.” Then Akhilletes replied, and said to them, “My brothers, we are prepared to stand before that fearful platform of Christ the king. Let's not become timid over this current platform.

Behold, we are hungry, and you know what Emperor Decius has ordered concerning us, and return to us.” For they had thought they slept that evening, and arisen. Now Diomites arose in the morning, and took for himself money from their coffers according to his custom, for which sixty-two mane was given, and from the seal, for which forty-four mane was given, this seal having been the one which existed from the ancient times up until the time of these holy ones.

But he thought nothing of them, and went down the mountain. And he'd been afraid to walk on the road. And he entered the city. For he was afraid that someone might recognize him, and reveal the matter about him, and he'd be arrested and turned in to Emperor Decius. And he wasn't aware that the bones of that lawless one were scattered about in hell. When Diometes reached the city, he lifted his eyes, and saw the shape of the cross nailed on the gate to the city.

			<p class="translation">greatly afraid and conflicted, Diometes suggested going out to the city. And like this, he made his way to those in the city who sold bread, in order to buy some. And he took out the money he had on him in his wallet in order to receive the bread. And when they saw that the seal of silver was large, and foreign, they were shocked. And they showed the copper to one another, and they put the money in the hands of those sitting, selling bread. And those sitting in the market were looking at Diometes, whispering, saying, “Has he found hidden treasure from a number of years ago?” And when Diometes looked at them whispering, he was afraid, and through cowardice, his body dissociated. For he was thinking that someone recognized him, wishing to turn him in to Decius. And others were looking at his face. He stood in agony, and said, “I beg you, behold, I don't want whatever bread money you've got.”</p>

Give us our share, and we will not reveal you. But if you don't wish to, we will turn you in to the judge.” And when Diometes heard these things, he was beside himself, saying, “This other thing puts an additional difficulty upon on me that I hadn't expected.” Those people said to him, “Young man, treasure of this sort can't hide like you think it does.” And Diometes was stumped, and couldn't figure out what he'd say, nor could he explain it to them. And, seeing him silent and not answering, they removed his facecloth and tossed it around his neck, and they stood in the center of the market, holding him.

He was looking, and observing the crowd, and didn't recognize anyone from his ancestry, it being apparent that he had been revered in the palace.

Since this seal and these writings on it appear to be from 372 years prior to today, and from before Emperor Decius, and hasn't changed, nor is it like the seal which exists today, which has the current exchange on it.

			<p class="translation">they went up the mountain to the cave of Orenokhlon, right to the holy martyrs, and the saints came out of the cave to meet the emperor. They all saw them, their faces bright like the sun, and the holy ones returned into the cave. The emperor went in as well, and grovelled at their feet. The holy ones extended their hands, and lifted him up. And as he got up, the emperor embraced them and cried. And like this, they all sat down on the ground. And the emperor was looking at them, thanking God, and his heart filled with gladness and joy, and confessing to God. And he said to them, “My lords, through your revelation, I think I see my Lord Jesus Christ, our king.

			<p class="translation">along with his glorious entry, at which time the dead would come out of the graves, indestructible. Glory be to him, as well as honor, strength, and eternal reign.” Akhilletes replied, and said to the emperor, “From now on, your empire will last through strength and faith, and my lord Jesus Christ, Son of the living God, will guard your empire from obstacles of evil. And believe us: it is because of you that God has raised us out of the ground prior to the evil of the resurrection which is to come, as we have died and lived again through the power of our god, like a child in its mother's womb, since it experiences neither glory, nor contempt, nor toil, nor comfort, nor does it experience through the living</p>

			<p class="translation">or the dead. So like this, we too are here, quiet, like those who sleep and sense nothing.” And these holy martyrs uttered these things to the emperor. And the emperor, the bishop, and the important people of the city, still looking at them and hearing what they were saying, immediately turned their heads down to the ground, and slept. And like this, they gave their last breath through God's command, with the emperor standing over them, crying, and he spread out his purple garment over them. The emperor ordered that he place their holy bodies among them. And that night, the holy ones appeared to the emperor in a dream, saying, “Our bodies have risen out of the ground, and not from gold or silver. Therefore, leave us where we are on the ground</p>

And he set them down there until now, and large crowds gathered, and held a great feast, thanking the holy martyrs according to their worth, and the emperor gave great valuables to the poor there, and he undid the straps of the bishops we'd previously brought up. And a large crowd of bishops and faithful ones left for Ephesos with him out of Constantinople because of the steadfastness of the faith, since he was thanking God, the one who always performs the miracles through these holy ones, victorious, pious, he to whom is the glory and the power, forever and ever. Amen. ⳾ The martyrdom of the seven children who are us: Akhilletes, Diometes,</p>
